# Below is Dynamic Programming based python implementation where an auxiliary array screen[N] is used to store result of subproblems. 
# As the number of Aâ€™s become large, the effect of pressing Ctrl-V more than 3 times starts 
# to become insubstantial as compared to just pressing Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V again.

# to find maximum number of A's
# that can be printed using four keys 

# this function returns the optimal 
# length string for N keystrokes

	# N when N is smaller than 7
	if (N <= 6):

	# subproblems
	screen = [0] * N

	# Initializing the optimal lengths 
	# array for until 6 input
	# strokes.

	# Solve all subproblems in bottom manner
	for n in range(7, N + 1):
		
		# for any keystroke n, we will need to choose between:-
		# 1. pressing Ctrl-V once after copying the
		# A's obtained by n-3 keystrokes.

		# 2. pressing Ctrl-V twice after copying the A's
		# obtained by n-4 keystrokes.

		# 3. pressing Ctrl-V thrice after copying the A's
		# obtained by n-5 keystrokes.
		screen[n - 1] = max(2 * screen[n - 4],

	# will reply on the previous
	# entries to compute new ones
